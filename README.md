# Yup validation course

I have created this repo to help my colleagues understand the `yup` library and show how powerful it can be.
It was designed as a set of exercises that everyone can make on their own.

This course requires some basic knowledge of `React` and `formik@2`. `Formik` is a great library that has built-in support for yup validation schemas.

The course quickly progress from very basic to more advanced exercises. You can always check the solution by switching to the `solutions` branch.

I hope you will have a great time learning `yup`.

## Lessons

1. Getting known with yup
2. Field arrays validations
3. Passing context to a schema, conditional validation, and transforming values
